# Application of Reinformcement Learning on OpenAI GYM Environments

This repository contains the implementation of several RL algorithms applied to OpenAI Gym environment. We provide several agents that are trained with different algorithm to play a game:

- Q-learning
- SARSA (State Action Reward State Action)
- DQN (Deep Q-Network)
